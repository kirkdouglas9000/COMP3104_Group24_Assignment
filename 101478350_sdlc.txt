Understanding DevOps is important because it connects IT operations with software development, creating a culture of collaboration, automation, 
and ongoing development across the software development lifecycle. 
By understanding DevOps principles, students learn how to streamline the build, test, and deployment processes, leading to faster delivery of reliable 
software.
Incorporating DevOps practices—such as Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and automated testing—reduces manual errors, 
improves code quality, and shortens release cycles. This approach ensures that software is always in a deployable state and can adapt quickly to user 
feedback or changing business needs.
Learning DevOps equips future developers and IT professionals with the skills to manage modern, scalable, and efficient software 
pipelines—making them more effective contributors to agile and cloud-based development environments.
Additionally, DevOps knowledge enhances teamwork by aligning goals between developers, testers, and operations teams, 
ensuring smoother communication and fewer bottlenecks during deployment
